      "q1": "Is my account safe on BASIS-64?",
      "a1": "Yes, we guarantee the security of your account during data exchange. All information sent to our servers is encrypted end-to-end using AES for data encryption and RSA for the key exchange process.",
      "q2": "Does the admin or owner of this website know my account password?",
      "a2": "No, we as the website owner cannot read your account password. All passwords are stored in encrypted form using a secure algorithm and cannot be viewed by anyone, including admins.",
      "q3": "What if I forget my account password?",
      "a3": "If you forget your account password, you can change your password by clicking 'Forgot Password' on the login page.",
      "q4": "How accurate is this translator?",
      "a4": "Currently, we use NLP (Natural Language Processing) technology to translate Dayak Kenyah more accurately, with up to 90% accuracy. This technology helps the system understand the structure and meaning of sentences, so translations are not only word-for-word, but also according to context. That way, users can get translation results that are more natural, easy to understand, and close to the original meaning.",
      "q5": "How do I make a payment?",
      "a5": "You can make payments via <a href=\"payment.html\">QRIS</a> or in cash by meeting the admin directly. You can get automatic activation after sending proof of payment if you pay via QRIS. You can contact <a href=\"https://wa.me/+622211509216\" target=\"_blank\">the admin via WhatsApp</a> if there are problems with activation.",
      "q6": "Is the BASIS-64 Dayak Kenyah translator free?",
      "a6": "No, the BASIS-64 Dayak Kenyah translator is <strong>not free.</strong> Users need to subscribe to access this feature. See the available package options <a href=\"price.html\" class=\"text-blue-600 underline\">here.</a> However, BASIS-64 occasionally opens free access during certain promotional periods — but this is very rare."
